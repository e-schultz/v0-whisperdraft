# Whisperdraft Refactoring Plan

This document outlines our incremental approach to refactoring Whisperdraft while maintaining functionality throughout the process.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, focused changes that can be tested independently
2. **Maintain Functionality**: The application should remain usable throughout the refactoring
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Each change should be tested before moving to the next
4. **Document Changes**: Update documentation as we go
5. **Commit Frequently**: Make small, atomic commits with clear messages

## Refactoring Phases

### Phase 1: Establish Provider Architecture (Foundation)

- Create basic provider components (AppProvider, NotificationProvider, ApiKeyProvider)
- Implement one provider at a time, starting with NotificationProvider
- Test thoroughly before moving to the next provider
- Keep existing code working alongside new providers during transition

### Phase 2: Improve Component Separation

- Extract smaller components from large ones (ChatPanel â†’ ChatMessages, EmptyChatState, etc.)
- Keep parent components intact while extracting children
- Add memoization for performance (React.memo, useCallback, useMemo)

### Phase 3: Enhance State Management

- Create custom hooks for store access (useAutoSave, useApiKey, useNotifications)
- Refactor existing components to use new hooks one at a time
- Test thoroughly after each update
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition

### Phase 4: Error Handling Improvements

- Centralize error handling with enhanced ErrorLogger
- Implement useRetry hook for operations that might fail
- Create consistent error UI components
- Add error boundaries strategically around key components
