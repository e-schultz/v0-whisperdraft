# Whisperdraft Design Principles

This document outlines the core design principles that guide the development of Whisperdraft. These principles should inform all design and implementation decisions.

## 1. Build Shacks, Not Cathedrals

Whisperdraft follows a philosophy of building "shacks, not cathedrals." This means:

- **Simplicity Over Complexity**: Choose the simpler solution even if it means fewer features
- **Modularity**: Build small, focused components that do one thing well
- **Maintainability**: Code should be easy to understand and modify
- **Pragmatism**: Solve real problems rather than theoretical ones

## 2. Local-First

Whisperdraft is designed to be local-first:

- **Data Ownership**: User data stays on their device by default
- **Offline Functionality**: Core features work without an internet connection
- **Privacy**: Minimize data sharing and external dependencies
- **Longevity**: Application should continue to function even if servers go offline

## 3. Minimalist UI

The user interface follows minimalist principles:

- **Focus on Content**: The writing is the star of the show
- **Reduce Cognitive Load**: Minimize distractions and unnecessary options
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Hide complexity until needed
- **Thoughtful Defaults**: Good defaults reduce the need for configuration

## 4. Thoughtful AI Integration

AI is integrated in a thoughtful, non-intrusive way:

- **AI as Assistant, Not Driver**: AI responds to user actions rather than leading
- **Gentle Presence**: AI feedback is quiet, present, and attentive
- **User Control**: Users can ignore or dismiss AI suggestions
- **Transparency**: Clear indication of when AI is being used

## 5. Accessibility and Inclusivity

Whisperdraft should be accessible to all users:

- **Screen Reader Support**: All features should work with screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality available via keyboard
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on all device sizes
- **Inclusive Language**: Use clear, inclusive language throughout

## 6. Performance

Performance is a feature:

- **Fast Startup**: Application should load quickly
- **Responsive Editing**: No lag or delay when typing
- **Efficient Processing**: Background tasks should not impact the user experience
- **Resource Conscious**: Minimal CPU and memory usage

## 7. Error Resilience

The application should be resilient to errors:

- **Graceful Degradation**: Features should degrade gracefully when errors occur
- **Data Preservation**: User data should never be lost due to errors
- **Clear Feedback**: Users should understand what went wrong
- **Recovery Options**: Provide ways to recover from errors

## Applying These Principles

When making design or implementation decisions, ask:

1. Does this align with our "shacks, not cathedrals" philosophy?
2. Does this preserve the local-first nature of the application?
3. Does this maintain the minimalist UI approach?
4. Does this integrate AI in a thoughtful way?
5. Is this accessible to all users?
6. Does this maintain or improve performance?
7. Is this resilient to errors?

If the answer to any of these questions is "no," reconsider the approach.
