export const WELCOME_NOTE = `# Welcome to Whisperdraft

A shack for thought, with a ghost in the walls.

Whisperdraft is a minimalist writing environment where your thoughts evolve freely, and an AI companion responds softly from the side. The left panel is yours — a quiet cabin for ideas. On the right, a presence listens. Every few lines, it stirs, offering suggestions or reflections drawn from your recent edits. It's not here to lead. Just to witness, reflect, and gently echo back.

## How to use

1. Start writing in this panel
2. Your changes will be saved automatically every 30 seconds
3. The AI companion will respond to your changes in the right panel
4. You can also manually save by clicking the "Save" button

## Philosophy

Born from a "build shacks, not cathedrals" philosophy, Whisperdraft is designed to be small, local-first, and modular. It stores diffs, tracks note evolution, and talks to an LLM — but only when asked. Ideal for writers, thinkers, and neurodivergent dreamers who want a space that honors process over polish.
